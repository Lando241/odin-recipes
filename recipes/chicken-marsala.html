      <h2>Chicken Marsala with Shittake Mushrooms, Prosciutto,
          and Grilled Broccolini</h2>

        <p>One of my favorite dishes to make. This receipe was originally
            obtianed from 
            <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/chicken-marsala-recipe-1951778">Tyler Florence of Food Network</a> 
            but I've given my own twist on the dish by substituing shittake mushrooms.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
